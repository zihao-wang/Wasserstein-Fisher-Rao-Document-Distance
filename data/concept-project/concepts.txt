Some organisms , such as fungi and bacteria , break down dead organisms ( both plants or plants parts and animals ) and therefore operate as “decomposers.” Decomposition eventually restores ( recycles ) some materials back to the soil . Organisms can survive only in environments in which their particular needs are met . A healthy ecosystem is one in which multiple species of different types are each able to meet their needs in a relatively stable web of life .

Organisms are related in food webs in which some animals eat plants for food and other animals eat the animals that eat plants . Some organisms , such as fungi and bacteria , break down dead organisms ( both plants or plants parts and animals ) and therefore operate as “decomposers.” Decomposition eventually restores ( recycles ) some materials back to the soil . Organisms can survive only in environments in which their particular needs are met . A healthy ecosystem is one in which multiple species of different types are each able to meet their needs in a relatively stable web of life .
